Another Python Graph Library 
============================

This project develops a simple, fast and easy to use Python graph library using NumPy, Scipy and PySparse. For information on installing, and usage, see http://packages.python.org/apgl/index.html. 

UPDATE: This project is no longer maintained. I recommend networkx (https://networkx.github.io/) or igraph (http://igraph.org/python/) instead.
